# 

Most errors are going to be one of 2 issues.\
\
1. Application Permission Issues or Missing Scopes

\
\
2. Missing on incorrect Api key

3. Api Limits. 

   If you set a cron to run every minute and you have alot of data, the api will likely reject your requests because you are hitting limitations. \
   Also investiation within your organization if someone else is also using your api key and or application apis. some Apps give the entire org a set limit of api requests over time. \
   \
   4. Badly formatted information (rare) \
   We consider this rare because the source application typically does not allow badly formatted information but it does happe. When these occur you cannot resolve this on your own. you need to contact support.
