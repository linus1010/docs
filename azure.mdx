# ðŸ”§ Azure Application Registration for API Access

This guide provides the steps to register and configure an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to access Microsoft APIs (like Microsoft Graph) or Azure Management APIs. This is often required for applications or services that need to interact with Azure resources or Microsoft 365 data programmatically.

## âœ… Step 1: Open Configview Secrets

Go to the Configview Secrets page using the following link:

[Configview Secrets](https://configview-dashboard-frontend.vercel.app/admin/secret/)

Keep this page handy as you will be copying values to here.

## âœ… Step 2: Retrieve Microsoft Tenant ID from Azure AD

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** in the Azure Portal using this link:
   [Microsoft Entra ID Overview](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview)
2. Copy the **Tenant ID** from the **Overview** page.
3. Return to the Configview Secrets page (from Step 1).
4. Paste the copied **Tenant ID** into the `MSFT_TENANT_ID` value section. **Do not change the key\!**
5. Save the changes in Configview.

## âœ… Step 3: Register an Application in Azure AD

1. Go back to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID**.
3. Select **App registrations** from the left-hand menu.
4. Click **New Registration**.
5. Enter a **Name** for the application (e.g., `Configview`).
6. Choose the **Single tenant** â€“ Only your organization's users/accounts can use it.
7. (Optional) Set a **Redirect URI** (required for user authentication flows, not typically for service-to-service API calls using client credentials).
8. Click **Register**.

---

## âœ… Step 4: Generate Client Credentials

Credentials are required for your application to authenticate itself to Azure AD and access APIs. Client secrets are one common method.

1. Navigate to **Certificates & Secrets** in your application settings menu.
2. Under **Client Secrets**, click **New Client Secret**.
3. Provide a **Description** (e.g., `Configview`).
4. Set an **Expiration** period (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, Never - _Never is not recommended for security reasons_).
5. Click **Add**.
6. **`Immediately copy the Value of the secret.`** This value will not be visible again after you leave this page. You will need to create another one if you need it again. Store it securely. You do not need the Secret ID.

## âœ… Step 5: Configure API Permissions

1. In your newly registered application, navigate to **API Permissions** from the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Add a permission**.
3. Choose the appropriate API:
   - **Microsoft Graph** (for Office 365 services such as SharePoint, Teams, and Users).
   - **Azure Management API** (for Azure resource data such as Virtual Machines and Storage).
   - You can search for other specific APIs if needed.
4. Select the required permissions:
   - **Delegated permissions** (if accessing data on behalf of a signed-in user).
   - **Application permissions** (if the app runs as a background service without a signed-in user).
5. Select the specific permissions required for your use case.
6. Click **Add Permissions**.
7. Click **Grant Admin Consent for [Your Organization Name]** (required for **Application permissions** to function properly and often for high-privilege **Delegated permissions**). Confirm the consent dialog.

## âœ… Step 6: Configure API Access (Optional - Specific to Azure Resource Management)

If your application needs to access Azure resources (like reading VM data or managing Storage Accounts) using the **Azure Management API**, you need to assign the application appropriate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles on the subscription, resource group, or resource.

1. Navigate to the specific Azure **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, or **Resource** the application needs access to.
2. Select **Access Control (IAM)** from the left-hand menu.
3. Click **Add Role Assignment**.
4. Select a suitable **Role** (e.g., `Reader`, `Contributor`, or a more specific built-in or custom role based on the principle of least privilege).
5. Under **Assign access to**, select `User, group, or service principal`.
6. Search for your registered application by its **Name** or **Client ID**.
7. Select the application.
8. Click **Save**.
