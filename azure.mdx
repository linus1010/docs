# ðŸ”§ Azure Application Registration for API Access

This guide provides the steps to register and configure an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to access Microsoft APIs (like Microsoft Graph) or Azure Management APIs. This is often required for applications or services that need to interact with Azure resources or Microsoft 365 data programmatically.

## âœ… Step 1: Open Configview Secrets

Go to the Configview Secrets page using the following link:

[Configview Secrets](https://configview-dashboard-frontend.vercel.app/admin/secret/)

Keep this page handy as you will be copying values to here.

## âœ… Step 2: Retrieve Microsoft Tenant ID from Azure AD

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** in the Azure Portal using this link:
   [Microsoft Entra ID Overview](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview)
2. Copy the **Tenant ID** from the **Overview** page.
3. Return to the Configview Secrets page (from Step 1).
4. Paste the copied **Tenant ID** into the `MSFT_TENANT_ID` value section. **Do not change the key\!**
5. Save the changes in Configview.

## âœ… Step 3: Register an Application in Azure AD

1. Go back to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID**.
3. Select **App registrations** from the left-hand menu.
4. Click **New Registration**.
5. Enter a **Name** for the application (e.g., `Configview`).
6. Choose the **Single tenant** â€“ Only your organization's users/accounts can use it.
7. (Optional) Set a **Redirect URI** (required for user authentication flows, not typically for service-to-service API calls using client credentials).
8. Click **Register**.

---

## âœ… Step 4: Generate Client Credentials

Credentials are required for your application to authenticate itself to Azure AD and access APIs. Client secrets are one common method.

1. Navigate to **Certificates & Secrets** in your application settings menu.
2. Under **Client Secrets**, click **New Client Secret**.
3. Provide a **Description** (e.g., `Configview`).
4. Set an **Expiration** period (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, Never - _Never is not recommended for security reasons_).
5. Click **Add**.
6. **`Immediately copy the Value of the secret.`** This value will not be visible again after you leave this page. You will need to create another one if you need it again. Store it securely. You do not need the Secret ID.

## âœ… Step 5: Configure API Permissions  You have to do this

1. In your newly registered application, navigate to **API Permissions** from the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Add a permission**.
3. Choose the appropriate API:
   For users, groups, applications, devices use:
   - **Microsoft Graph** (for Office 365 services such as SharePoint, Teams, and Users).
   - **Application permissions** (if the app runs as a background service without a signed-in user).

   When adding the scopes you can scroll and select or you can copy the scopes below and select. it save stime.

```text

User.Read.All
User.ReadBasic.All
Group.Read.All
GroupMember.Read.All
Application.Read.All
Policy.Read.All
Policy.Read.ConditionalAccess
Policy.Read.IdentityProtection
Policy.Read.PermissionGrant
Domain.Read.All
MultiTenantOrganization.Read.All
MultiTenantOrganization.ReadBasic.All
```

Optional Scopes:

```text
BitlockerKey.Read.All
Policy.Read.DeviceConfiguration
```

Once done click Grant admin consent

You are now ready to start ingesting data into configview.

Azure data \
\
You'll need to do this for each subscription.

note: you may be able to do this at the tenant root group \
\
**Assign the "Reader" role to your Service Principal at the Root Management Group scope:** 

- Go to "Management Groups".
- Select your Root Management Group.
- Go to "Access control (IAM)".
- Click "Add" -\> "Add role assignment".

- **Members:** Search for the name of your Azure AD application registration (Service Principal) and select it.
- **Save** the role assignment.

\

If you are wishing to get azure data you need to add an additional scope:\
in configview secrets  MSFT_AZURE_SCOPE in key and in value: 

1. Click **Add a permission**.
2. Choose the appropriate API: For users, groups, applications, devices use:
   - **Azure Service Management** (for Office 365 services such as SharePoint, Teams, and Users).
   - **Delegated Permissions permissions** (if the app runs as a background service without a signed-in user).
